# Tracking Water Hyacinth at Hartbeespoort Dam
This project, part of the Centre for Biological Control's Aquatic Weeds program at Rhodes University,
focuses on predicting and tracking the invasive Water Hyacinth at Hartbeespoort Dam using machine learning and satellite imagery.

## Project Overview
**Objective:** Predict and track the location and distribution of Water Hyacinth mats.<br>
**Scope:** Hartbeespoort Dam, located east of Pretoria, South Africa.<br>
**Tools Used:** Google Earth Engine, Landsat/Sentinel satellite images, weather data.<br>
## Deliverables
